ðŸ‘‹ Greetings fellow CoDe's!! Welcome to the central source code organisation for all things CoDe related (launched 2025/01/29). The organisational repository serves to centrally host repositories related to projects or development work. Our aim is to streamline and standardise the development or scripts, code and related programming resources under a single domain, ensuring best practice is adopted and maintained as best as possible. 

The .github folder will contain the organisational information and getting started information.
